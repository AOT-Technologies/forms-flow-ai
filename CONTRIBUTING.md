# Contributing to formsflow.ai

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer


## So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests as We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure CI actions pass.
5. Issue that pull request!


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/aot-technologies/forms-flow-ai/issues)
Report a bug by [opening a new issue]()

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Write bug reports with enough details for collaborators and maintainers to understand.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
