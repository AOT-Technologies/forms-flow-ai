## formsflow.ai: Enterprise-Grade Automation without the Lock-in

[**formsflow.ai**](https://formsflow.ai/) is the open-source alternative to restrictive low-code platforms. We provide a unified stack that combines the world's most trusted engines for forms, workflow, and security into a single, seamless developer experience.

### The Power of "Best-of-Breed" Integration

Unlike "black box" proprietary vendors, formsflow.ai is built on a transparent foundation. We've done the heavy lifting of integrating [Form.io](https://form.io), [Camunda](https://camunda.com/), [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), and [Redash](https://redash.io/), allowing you to focus on building logic rather than managing infrastructure.

### Why formsflow.ai?

- **Low-Code Speed, Pro-Code Power**: Use intuitive drag-and-drop builders for 90% of your application, while retaining the ability to inject custom code and complex **BPMN 2.0** or **DMN** logic for sophisticated business requirements.
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in**: Own your data and your destiny. Built entirely on open-source standards, our architecture ensures you aren't tied to a single provider's proprietary roadmap.
- **Mission-Critical Workflows**: Designed for the high-compliance needs of Government and Enterprise, supporting everything from simple intake forms to multi-departmental digital transformation.
