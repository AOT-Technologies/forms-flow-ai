 The framework installs the products mentioned above (except for Keycloak which must either be pre-existing or installed and configured in advance).

The products are installed with a default configuration so that the base system works "out-the-box", however, the advanced configuration and management of the products require the relevant product documentation. 

#### Prerequisites

* Admin access to a local or remote server (can be local PC or Mac provided it is 64-bit with at least 16GB RAM and 100GB HDD) where [docker-compose](https://docker.com) and [docker](https://docker.com) are installed and configured. 
* Admin access to a [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) server  (ability to create realms, users etc.)
