## Deployment For New Users

### Download the formsflow.ai

* Clone this github repo:  https://github.com/AOT-Technologies/forms-flow-ai
* If deploying to a remote server, you can use nginx as a reverse proxy and SSL engine. To help you, follow the instructions in the nginx [README](../nginx/README.md)

* (One time ) Update the ssl keystore name and password in forms-flow-bpm/src/main/resources/application.yaml.
  
 ```camunda.bpm:
  history-level: audit
  authorization:
  enabled: true
  filter:
  create: All tasks
  webapp:
  application-path: /
  server:
  port: 8443
  ssl:
    key-store: file:/certs/keystore.ks
    key-store-password: password
    key-store-type: pkcs12
    key-alias: tomcat
    key-password: password
  servlet.context-path: /camunda
```

*  Follow the below steps for mapping the role IDs.   
   - Start the forms-flow-forms service.
       - Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml up -d forms-flow-forms` to start.

For new Users go to the corresponding folder **/deployment/docker** and open **Sample.env** file.

Steps to Remember before changing the variables:
* Make sure your current working directory is "/forms-flow-ai/deployment/docker".
* Modify the environment variables in the newly created **sample.env** file if needed. 
* **NOTE** : {your-ip-address} given inside the **sample.env** file should be changed to your host system IP address.

#### This is how we perform a deployment for the very first time. All the componants mentioned in the dependencies should be properly installed and follow the installation steps. Following these guides, makes it easy for new users to make a deployment. 


## Deployment For Existing Users


#### Deployment for the already exsisting users doesn't require any further installation. Take a pull and do the deployment steps mentioned below.

##### 1.	Login to the server using ip.
```
ssh {your ip address}
```

##### 2.	Navigate to forms-flow-ai directory.
```
apps/ forms-flow-ai-dev/deployment/docker/
```
    
##### 3.	Check the status of the git.
```
git status
```
##### 4. Stop all containers running in the docker.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml stop
```

##### 5.	Pull the master files.
```
git pull origin master
```

##### 6.	Check the stash list and find the temporary storage area.
```
git stash list
```

##### 7.  Revert the stash changes back.
```
git stash apply
```

##### 8.	Check the docker containers running inside the docker.
```
docker ps
```

##### 9. To restart all docker images that are currently available on docker.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml up â€“build -d
```
