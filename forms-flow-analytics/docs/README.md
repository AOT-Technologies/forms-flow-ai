## How to use forms-flow-analytics?


The process of how to use Redash is well documented in official docs. Some of the basic steps for working with Redash are:

1. Add Data sources 

You can connect with about 30+ supported data sources mentioned in docs from the browser itself.

2. Write Queries
 Once data is connected we can write queries. Itâ€™s always ideal to create individual queries for the necessary visualizations. Writing queries is a data preparation step to process data for visualization
 
3. Create Visualizations 

There are a variety of visualizations supported in Redash. Ten different categories of visualization can be created with just drag and select features to visualize from the queried data. Redash supports visualization types like BoxPlot, Counter, BarCharts, Sunburst, Sankey, Word Cloud, line chart, Area charts, etc. To learn how to create visualizations checkout Redash visualization docs.

4. Create Dashboards

We can create interactive dashboards that can be embedded anywhere and shared with colleagues easily. The queries can be refreshed periodically as more data comes in.
