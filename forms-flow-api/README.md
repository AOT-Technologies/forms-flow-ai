**formsflow.ai** has built this adaptive tier for correlating form management, BPM and analytics together.

The goal of the REST API is to provide access to all relevant interfaces of 
the system. It is built using Python :snake: .

## Prerequisites

* For docker installation [Docker](https://docker.com) need to be installed.

## Solution Setup

### Installation

If you are interested in contributing to the project, you can install through docker or locally.

It's recommended to download dev-packages to follow Python coding standards for project like PEP8 by installing dev-packages using pip:

```python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt```

### Keycloak Setup

No specific client creation is required. Audience has been added for clients 
**forms-flow-web** and **forms-flow-bpm**.  

### Environment Configuration

   * Make sure you have a Docker machine up and running.
   * Make sure your current working directory is "forms-flow-ai/forms-flow-api".
   * Rename the file [sample.env](./sample.env) to **.env**.
   * Modify the environment variables in the newly created **.env** file if needed. Environment variables are given in the table below,
   * **NOTE : {your-ip-address} given inside the .env file should be changed to your host system IP address. Please take special care to identify the correct IP address if your system has multiple network cards**

> :information_source: Variables with trailing :triangular_flag_on_post: in below table should be updated in the .env file

**NOTE : Default realm is `forms-flow-ai`**

### Running the Application

* forms-flow-api service uses port 5000, make sure the port is available.
* `cd {Your Directory}/forms-flow-ai/forms-flow-api`

* For Linux,
   * Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml up -d` to start.
* For Windows,
   * Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-windows.yml up -d` to start.
   
*NOTE: Use --build command with the start command to reflect any future **.env** changes eg : `docker-compose -f docker-compose-windows.yml up --build -d`*

#### To Stop the Application
* For Linux,
  * Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml stop` to stop.
* For Windows,
  * Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-windows.yml stop` to stop.
   
### Verify the Application Status

   The application should be up and available for use at port defaulted to 5000 in http://localhost:5000/
  
  * Access the **/checkpoint** endpoint for a Health Check on API to see it's up and running.
``` 
GET http://localhost:5000/checkpoint

RESPONSE

{
    "message": "Welcome to formsflow.ai API"
}
```
   * Get the access token
```
POST {Keycloak URL}/auth/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token

Body:
grant_type: client_credentials
client_secret: {set client token}
client_id: forms-flow-bpm

Headers:
Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded

```   
   * Access the **/task** endpoint and verify response. Ensure Bearer token is passed along
``` 
GET http://localhost:5000/task

Headers:
Content-Type : application/json
Authorization: Bearer {access token}
``` 
   
## Steps for enabling Sentiment Analysis component

One of the unique features of the formsflow.ai framework is Sentiment Analysis. It can
analyze the sentiment from forms based on specific topics mentioned by the designer
during form creation.

- A form designer can drag and drop **Text Area with Analytics component** and in section
**Data** add key topics for Sentiment Analysis like facility, service, etc. This activates
sentiment analysis component.
- Based on the input responses of the user formsflow.ai process sentiment associated
 with each user's responses and stores it MongoDB database using **Python API**.
- You can take data stored in mongodb and create **meaningful visualization** based on the 
output of sentiment API in Redash dashboards. This information can be found in the **Insights section**
for staff user formsflow.ai.

### About Sentiment Analysis model

Currently, the ML model is build leveraging libraries like Spacy and NLTK. It uses a two
stage pipeline process to find the entities belonging to a topic and their associated
sentiment. We use a named entity recognition model(NER) to train to identify the topics,
and further sentiment analysis is being done for individual entities.
