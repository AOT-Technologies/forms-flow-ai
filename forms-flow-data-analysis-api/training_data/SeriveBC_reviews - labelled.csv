All of my picture identification has been lost/stolen. I'm told that in order to get picture ID, I require picture ID. Now, if I had picture ID, I'd hardly need to request aid in attaining a replacement, would I? The person I spoke to was courteous (to a point) but was as useful as a potato in this regard. This circular waste of time is costly to both me and Provincial Services. Get real. This is a Beaureucratic stupidity that needs to be resolved immediately. I can stand in a queue for an hour at BC Services, speak to an agent that I've known for years, have them pull up my previous picture IDs on their computer, see my face and my signature, my tenancy agreement, my mail etc. and still be told that the agent can't help me? I then have to spend my time in another queue, be kept on hold on the phone if I can't linger in their office like a bad smell or have to write this to make a simple point? The point being ""Give me the picture of me that is MY ID"". Outrageous! What are you paid for? Platitudes? This is ridiculous. I've lived here for 40 years and a kid has easier access to photo ID. It is non-sensical. With all due respect... Robert Stephen Dugdale.",negative,Victoria

I drive a 2021 Mazda CX-5 that will beep at you if you come within 1 foot of another vehicle, and the tester literally jumped and screamed in the passenger seat while I was driving at a normal speed, in my lane, past a parked car more than 3 feet away from the car while my car did not make a sound.

115,116,63,,"Wait on line Outdoors was about one hour, waiting on a chair indoors about twenty minutes. Service was about as quick as normal. Staff seems to be dealing with these restrictions quite well with the exception of the front desk who seems rather short-tempered. And rightly so as people keep bypassing the line and just walking into the building and she must constantly tell them to go back into line. Once inside, social distancing is taken to the extreme and cleanliness is over the top. This is probably the safest space in the whole City.",positive,Vernon
116,117,63,,"My experience with Service BC in Vernon has been outstanding. They helped me register my well which was complicated and time-consuming.

Tried to book an appointment online through their website, and was told that I had to book it in person. Waited in line for an hour, only to be told that I had to call in.

All instructions were clear and understandable, and after the road test, the advise and feedback was very constructive. The instructor who gives the road test is not there to fail you, but to make sure that you are driving safely. Given the terrible driving habits of some people out there, I'm all for ICBC setting a high bar for passing the road test.",positive,Salmon Arm

183,184,49,,The staff who helped me was very rude and condescending. She talked over me and didn’t let me finish asking my question - completely interrupted me.

Because I didn’t have the correct documents (I didn’t know what I needed) she instantly turned me away and didn’t want me wasting her time.Not good customer service.,negative,Revelstoke
