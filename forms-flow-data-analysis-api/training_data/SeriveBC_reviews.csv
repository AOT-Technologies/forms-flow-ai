104,105,64,,"The person with whom I spoke was oblivious to my concern. She could neither answer my questions nor direct me to someone who could help me resolve my difficulty. All of my picture identification has been lost/stolen. I'm told that in order to get picture ID, I require picture ID. Now, if I had picture ID, I'd hardly need to request aid in attaining a replacement, would I? The person I spoke to was courteous (to a point) but was as useful as a potato in this regard. This circular waste of time is costly to both me and Provincial Services. Get real. This is a Beaureucratic stupidity that needs to be resolved immediately. I can stand in a queue for an hour at BC Services, speak to an agent that I've known for years, have them pull up my previous picture IDs on their computer, see my face and my signature, my tenancy agreement, my mail etc. and still be told that the agent can't help me? I then have to spend my time in another queue, be kept on hold on the phone if I can't linger in their office like a bad smell or have to write this to make a simple point? The point being ""Give me the picture of me that is MY ID"". Outrageous! What are you paid for? Platitudes? This is ridiculous. I've lived here for 40 years and a kid has easier access to photo ID. It is non-sensical. With all due respect... Robert Stephen Dugdale.",Victoria

113,114,63,,Best to make an appointment else you may wait in line for up to 2 hours with covid protocols in place limiting the number of people inside. Metered parking in the area. Be sure to plug the parking meter for a while if you decide to wing it with out an appt else you may end up with a parking ticket to top of your day. Friendly staff. It's not the staff that are slow is just the slow process of the system/technology/business process.,Vernon
114,115,63,,"Do not suggest this place for your road test. I drive a 2021 Mazda CX-5 that will beep at you if you come within 1 foot of another vehicle, and the tester literally jumped and screamed in the passenger seat while I was driving at a normal speed, in my lane, past a parked car more than 3 feet away from the car while my car did not make a sound. It seemed as though he did not have something right in his head as he would not leave my vehicle long after the test was finished and we had finished talking and it was extremely uncomfortable.",Vernon
115,116,63,,"Wait on line Outdoors was about one hour, waiting on a chair indoors about twenty minutes. Service was about as quick as normal. Staff seems to be dealing with these restrictions quite well with the exception of the front desk who seems rather short-tempered. And rightly so as people keep bypassing the line and just walking into the building and she must constantly tell them to go back into line. Once inside, social distancing is taken to the extreme and cleanliness is over the top. This is probably the safest space in the whole City.",Vernon
116,117,63,,"My experience with Service BC in Vernon has been outstanding. They helped me register my well which was complicated and time-consuming. Rather than make me try and deal with that on a glitchy web page, I was given the option of coming into the office and have someone help me through it. Saved me a lot of stress! They were also extremely helpful when I made application to put a foot bridge across the creek on my property.",Vernon

Tried to book an appointment online through their website, and was told that I had to book it in person. Waited in line for an hour, only to be told that I had to call in. If they're so uptight about what appointments need to occur online or in person, maybe put the correct information on their website to begin with instead of wasting everybody's time.",Vernon

135,136,63,,"If I could rate this office less than one star, I would. The staff was completely unhelpful and extremely rude. We were treated as an inconvenience. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this place to anyone, worst experience with a Service BC Iâ€™ve ever had.",Vernon

Then you can explore the rest of the museum (about 4 rooms) of interesting memorabilia and historical pieces. Each of which the staff are happy to explain the significances of. I would definitely recommend this museum to anyone travelling into Stewart. Itâ€™s a great way to gather some serious appreciation for such a small wonderful community with such an interesting history that is still in the making.,Stewart

All instructions were clear and understandable, and after the road test, the advise and feedback was very constructive.
