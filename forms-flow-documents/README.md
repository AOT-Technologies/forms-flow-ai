## Prerequisites

* For docker based installation [Docker](https://docker.com) need to be installed.
* Admin access to [Keycloak](../forms-flow-idm/keycloak) server and ensure audience(camunda-rest-api) is setup in Keycloak-bpm server.

## Solution Setup

If you are interested in contributing to the project, you can install through docker or locally.

It's recommended to download dev-packages to follow Python coding standards for project like PEP8 if you are interested in contributing to project.
You installing dev-packages using pip as follows:

```python3 -m pip install -r requirements/dev.txt```

### Keycloak Setup

No specific client creation is required. Audience has been added for clients
**forms-flow-web** and **forms-flow-bpm**.  

### Environment Configuration

* Make sure you have a Docker machine up and running.
* Make sure your current working directory is "forms-flow-ai/forms-flow-documents".
* Rename the file [sample.env](./sample.env) to **.env**.
* Modify the environment variables in the newly created **.env** file if needed. Environment variables are given in the table below,
* **NOTE : {your-ip-address} given inside the .env file should be changed to your host system IP address. Please take special care to identify the correct IP address if your system has multiple network cards**

#### To Stop the Application

* Run `docker-compose stop` to stop.

### Verify the Application Status

   The application should be up and available for use at port defaulted to 5006 in <http://localhost:5006/>
  
* Access the **/checkpoint** endpoint for a Health Check on API to see it's up and running.

```
GET http://localhost:5006/checkpoint
