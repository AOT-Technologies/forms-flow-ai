## Prerequisites

* For docker based installation [Docker](https://docker.com) need to be installed.
* Admin access to a [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) server. For local development / testing follow [Keycloak installation](../forms-flow-idm/keycloak).
* Please make sure the [Formio server](../forms-flow-forms/) is up and running.

## Solution Setup

### Keycloak Setup

***Skip this step if you are already having a setup ready.***

* Detailed instructions on setting up Keycloak for **formsflow.ai web application**
is mentioned on the [link](../forms-flow-idm/keycloak/README.md#create-forms-flow-web-client).

### Installation

   * Make sure you have a Docker machine up and running.
   * Make sure your current working directory is "forms-flow-ai/forms-flow-web".
   * *Skip this if forms-flow-analytics setup is completed* - Start the **analytics server** by following the instructions given on  [readme](../forms-flow-analytics/README.md)
   * Rename the file [sample.env](./sample.env) to **.env**.
   * Modify the environment variables in the newly created **.env** file if needed. Environment variables are given in the table below,
   * **NOTE : {your-ip-address} given inside the .env file should be changed to your host system IP address. Please take special care to identify the correct IP address if your system has multiple network cards**

> :information_source: Variables with trailing :triangular_flag_on_post: in below table should be updated in the .env file

 Variable name | Meaning | Possible values | Default value |

#### To stop the application
   * Run `docker-compose stop` to stop.

### Health Check

   * The application should be up and available for use at port defaulted to 3000 in  http://localhost:3000/
   * Default user credentials are provided [here](../forms-flow-idm/keycloak/README.md#formsflow-ai-user-credentials).
